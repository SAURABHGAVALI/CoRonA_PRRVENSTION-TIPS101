  <h2>6 Key points to keep on your Mind To Protect Yourself From Corona Virus</h2>


  <p>

    <meta charset="utf-8" />Coronavirus has taken the world by storm, and everybody is talking about the virus. In this world of the Internet, where everyone has a voice, fake news travel faster than actual news.<br />


    <p>&nbsp;<br />


      <p>That is why even after so much is written and covered about coronavirus. People aren&#39;t aware of how to protect themselves.<br />


        <p>&nbsp;<br />


          <p>So, here are six key points to keep in mind to protect yourself.<br />


            <p>&nbsp;<br />

              <hr>

              <p><strong>1. Origin of the Virus :</strong><br />


                <p><img alt="" src="Images/Corona-Origin101.jpeg" class="img"><br />


                  <p>Many conspiracy theories are floating on the internet that the virus is a bio-weapon created by china to control its population, or it is an experiment gone wrong.<br />


                    <p>&nbsp;<br />


                      <p>There is also a video of people eating bats, and it is inferred that bats are giving the virus to humans. An earlier version of coronaviruses was originated from bats, but this is a new virus, and there is no concrete
                        evidence of this virus transmitted from the bats.<br />


                        <p>&nbsp;<br />


                          <p>However, there isn&#39;t enough evidence to point to somewhere else. Hence, the virus can come from anywhere, so don&#39;t eat anything which isn&#39;t clean.<br />


                            <p>&nbsp;<br />

<hr>
                              <p><strong>2. Transmission of Coronavirus :</strong><br />


                                <p><img alt="" src="Images/Corona-Transmission102.jpg" class="img"><br />


                                  <p>A virus is considered deadly if it can transmit itself to other hosts very quickly. As we can see, although coronavirus doesn&#39;t have a high fatality rate but it is spreading at a really fast pace.<br />


                                    <p>&nbsp;<br />


                                      <p>Hence, a large number of people are at risk due to coronavirus. The virus is currently transmitting from person to person. This is why people are avoiding handshakes or social gatherings because even a single
                                        infected person can transmit the virus to everyone else.<br />


                                        <p>&nbsp;<br />


                                          <p>This is the reason why people coming from infected places are checked for the virus and infected host placed in quarantine to avoid the transmission of coronavirus.<br />


                                            <p>&nbsp;<br />

                                              <p><strong>3. Wear Masks :</strong><br />


                                                <p><img alt="" src="Images/Corona-Mask_Key103.jpeg" class="img" /><br />


                                                  <p>As stated above, the virus is spreading from person to person. One of the ways is through coughing. When a person cough, he breathes out things from his body, including the virus, and if someone
                                                    else breathes the air and he also inhales the virus.<br />


                                                    <p>&nbsp;<br />


                                                      <p>Hence, it is wise not to visit places with a chance of you getting infected and secondly wear masks everywhere you go. This will significantly reduce the chance of the virus inhaled by
                                                        you.<br />

                                                              <p>When we are young, we are told to wash everything and our hands each time we eat. Most of us follow this rule in our childhood, but as we grow, this habit gets lost somewhere.<br />


                                                                <p>&nbsp;<br />

                                                                    your body.<br />

                                                                        hands off.<br />
